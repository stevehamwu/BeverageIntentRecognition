# Accurate Performance Evaluation Report

**Generated on:** 2025-09-26 16:29:05

## Test Methodology

This evaluation uses **unique queries** for each request to avoid caching and measure actual LLM inference performance.

### Key Differences from Previous Tests:
- ✅ Each query contains unique identifiers to prevent cache hits
- ✅ Measures both client-side and API-reported response times
- ✅ Separates cached vs non-cached performance analysis
- ✅ Accounts for actual LLM processing time

## Performance Results Summary

### Request Success Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Requests | 10 |
| Successful Requests | 10 |
| Failed Requests | 0 |
| Success Rate | 100.0% |

### Cache Analysis
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cached Responses | 0 |
| Non-Cached Responses | 10 |
| Cache Hit Rate | 0.0% |

## Response Time Analysis

### All Requests (Including Cached)

| Metric | Client Measured | API Reported |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Minimum | 4361ms | 4351ms |
| Maximum | 5844ms | 5838ms |
| Average | 5374ms | 5367ms |
| Median | 5774ms | 5767ms |

### Non-Cached Requests Only (Actual LLM Inference)

| Metric | Client Measured | API Reported |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Minimum | 4361ms | 4351ms |
| Maximum | 5844ms | 5838ms |
| Average | 5374ms | 5367ms |
| Median | 5774ms | 5767ms |

### Performance Assessment

**LLM Inference Time Analysis:**
- ⚠️ **High inference time**: 5367ms average (>5s)
- 🔧 **Recommendation**: Consider LLM optimization or timeout adjustment
- ⚠️ **Low caching**: 0.0% hit rate - most requests hit LLM

## Recommendations

### Performance Optimization
- ⚠️ **High**: LLM inference time >5s - optimization recommended
- 📊 Monitor user experience and consider performance improvements

### Caching Strategy
- Current cache hit rate: 0.0%
- Caching effectively reduces response time for repeated queries
- Consider expanding cache TTL if appropriate for your use case

### Production Deployment
- ✅ **Ready for production** with proper monitoring
- Set up alerts for response time and error rate
- Consider load balancing for high-traffic scenarios
